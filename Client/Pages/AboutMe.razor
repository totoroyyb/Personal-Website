    <p class="leading-relaxed whitespace-normal mt-4">
        I am Yibo Yan. I am currently an undergraduate CS and Stats double major student at UC Davis. 
        I consider myself as a highly self-motivated person who is interested in a wide range of topics in Computer Science and eager to try out and learn new technologies. 
        
        <br/><br/>
        Although no previous experience of CS before university, fortunately, I was able to have some valuable experiences on various topics during the undergrad education via in-class or after-class activities. 
        I had experiences and interests on mobile app development (iOS specifically), web app development, software engineering in general, machine learning, data science, operating system. I also had some limited experience on AI and computer vision (graphics). Recently, I am learning more about OS kernels and Rust!
