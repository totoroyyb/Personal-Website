# Meet Yibo Yan

This is the repo of source code of my personal website. 

## Ackownledgement

I designed and programmed this [website](https://www.meetybyan.com). This website is built with [Blazor WASM](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-5.0#blazor-webassembly), continously deployed by [GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) as [Azure Static Web App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/static/).

Credits to [TailWindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) which makes styling in HTML way easier than ever. I also applied some design elements from [Hydejack](https://hydejack.com/), which is my most favorite, beautiful Jekyll blog theme.
